Unity ColourLovers Importer

A simple editor tool to search and load colours and palettes directly from colourlovers.com. 
Hooks into the ColourLovers API (www.colourlovers.com/api)

There are options to edit and save the palettes returned. Unfortunately Unity doesn't expose the ColorPresetLibrary so the preset assets are generated based on a text asset (ITS SO BAD BUT HEY IT WORKS).
